# .NET Learning Plan

## Overview
This plan covers essential .NET concepts progressing from foundations to building real-world applications. Each topic is structured to build incrementally on previous knowledge.

## Lesson Structure

### Foundation (1-3)
1. **C# Fundamentals** - Core language features, syntax, and type system
2. **Object-Oriented Programming** - Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces
3. **Functional Programming Concepts** - Lambdas, LINQ, delegates, immutability

### Core .NET Platform (4-6)
4. **.NET Architecture & Runtime** - CLR, MSIL, compilation, execution model
5. **Namespaces & Assemblies** - Organization, versioning, dependencies
6. **Memory Management & Garbage Collection** - Heap/stack, disposal patterns, performance

### Working with Data (7-9)
7. **Collections & Generics** - Lists, dictionaries, sets, custom generic types
8. **Entity Framework Core** - Database mapping, queries, migrations, relationships
9. **Serialization & JSON** - Data transformation, file I/O, API communication

### Building Applications (10-14)
10. **ASP.NET Core Basics** - Routing, controllers, middleware, dependency injection
11. **Web APIs & REST** - Controllers, HTTP methods, status codes, error handling
12. **Authentication & Authorization** - Identity, JWT tokens, roles, claims
13. **Async & Concurrency** - Async/await, tasks, threading, parallel processing
14. **Testing** - Unit testing, mocking, integration testing frameworks

### Production Concerns (15-17)
15. **Logging, Configuration, & Environment Management** - Structured logging, appsettings, environments
16. **Performance & Optimization** - Benchmarking, profiling, common bottlenecks
17. **Deployment & DevOps** - Docker, CI/CD, cloud hosting (Azure)

### Advanced Topics (18-20)
18. **Caching & State Management** - In-memory caching, distributed caching, sessions
19. **Background Jobs & Services** - Background workers, hosted services, queuing
20. **Advanced Patterns** - Repository pattern, CQRS, event sourcing basics

## Learning Strategy

- **Code Along**: Every lesson includes practical examples
- **Project-Based**: Build a progression of projects (console → library → web API → full application)
- **Practical Focus**: Emphasize real-world usage over theoretical deep-dives
- **Incremental Complexity**: Early lessons focus on understanding; later lessons combine multiple concepts

## Prerequisites
- Basic programming knowledge (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)
- Familiarity with command line/terminal
- A code editor (VS Code, Visual Studio, or similar)
