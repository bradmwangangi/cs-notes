# Domain Driven Design (DDD) Lesson Plan

## Overview
This lesson plan is designed to teach Domain Driven Design (DDD) progressively, starting with foundational concepts and moving to practical implementation. We'll use TypeScript for all code examples to demonstrate DDD patterns in a strongly-typed language.

## Lesson Structure
The course is divided into 8 modules, with each module building on the previous ones. We'll cover both strategic and tactical patterns, culminating in a complete example application.

## Module 1: Introduction to Domain Driven Design
- What is DDD and why it matters
- The problem DDD solves (complex business domains)
- Key principles and mindset
- Brief history and evolution

## Module 2: Domain and Subdomains
- Understanding the domain
- Identifying subdomains (Core, Supporting, Generic)
- Domain modeling basics
- Domain experts and ubiquitous language

## Module 3: Bounded Contexts
- What are bounded contexts?
- Context boundaries and their importance
- Multiple models for different contexts
- Communication between bounded contexts

## Module 4: DDD Building Blocks - Part 1 (Entities & Value Objects)
- Entities: Identity and lifecycle
- Value Objects: Immutability and equality
- Implementation in TypeScript
- Hands-on: Modeling a simple domain

## Module 5: DDD Building Blocks - Part 2 (Aggregates & Repositories)
- Aggregates: Consistency boundaries
- Root entities and aggregate rules
- Repositories: Data access abstraction
- Implementation patterns in TypeScript

## Module 6: Domain Services & Application Services
- Domain Services: Business logic that doesn't fit entities
- Application Services: Orchestrating use cases
- Layer separation
- Transaction management

## Module 7: Strategic Patterns
- Context Mapping patterns
- Anti-corruption layers
- Shared kernel
- Published language

## Module 8: Complete Example Application
- Building a realistic e-commerce domain
- Implementing all patterns together
- Testing DDD applications
- Common pitfalls and best practices

## Learning Approach
- Each module includes theoretical explanation
- TypeScript code examples
- Practical exercises
- Progressive complexity
- Real-world application examples

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of object-oriented programming
- Familiarity with TypeScript (interfaces, classes, generics)
- Experience with software design patterns

## Expected Outcomes
By the end of this course, you'll be able to:
- Model complex business domains effectively
- Design software that reflects business needs
- Implement DDD patterns in TypeScript
- Make informed decisions about when to apply DDD
- Avoid common DDD implementation mistakes
